# Invoice

🧾✨ HTML Invoice Project – A Practical UI Exercise!

Proud to share one of my recent front-end mini projects — a stylish, functional invoice page built using pure HTML & CSS, with a touch of JavaScript (planned for future validation).

💡 Key Highlights:
🔹 Custom-styled invoice layout
🔹 Clean tabular design with pastel aesthetics
🔹 Signature section & dynamic info rows
🔹 Fully responsive and visually appealing
🔹 Real-world product mock data

From background styling to elegant fonts and layout — this project helped me sharpen my HTML/CSS skills while learning how to create professional, printable web documents. 🧑‍💻📄
